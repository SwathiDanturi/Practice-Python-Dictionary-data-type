> **COMP-801 Integrated Computing Practice**
# Lab 4

## Due Dates
- Assigned Week 6
- Due before midnight before Week 7 class

## Requirements
- Complete AR5. Give special attention to Ch 11 Dictionaries.
- Develop the constructor in the class `ProgrammingLanguages`
- Develop two instance methods in the class `ProgrammingLanguages`
- Use test-driven incremental development to
  - document the modules
  - write test cases for the methods
  - design how the methods should be implemented
  - implement the methods.
- Apply version control to demonstrate the development steps. 

## Getting Started
Follow the steps used in previous labs and homework to:
1. Clone the rempte repo in your `comp801/labs` directory with appropriate `git` command in a `bash` terminal
2. Open **lab4** in VS Code
  - Read the code in all five Python modules: `ProgrammingLanguages.py`,  `client.py`, and three testing modules. 
  - Run all three modules and fix errors and **Problems** reported by VS Code, if any
3. Create testing modules for the methods in `ProgrammingLanguages.py` class.  
4. Check and fix the errors reported in the **Problems** tab of the VS Code integrated terminal.

## Evaluation
#### Documentation, 10 pts
- It's all or nothing
  - Full credit, 10 pts, if nothing is missing
  - No credit otherwise.

In each file (`.py` and `DESIGN.md`) enter your name and your collaborator(s) names. 

### Testing, 20 pts
- 1 additional testing function for the constructor
- 1 additional testing function for `find_langauges()`
- 2 testing functions for `find_programmers()`

### DESIGN.md, 30 pts
- 10 pts for designing each `ProgrammingLangauges` method, including the construcctor


### Implementation, 12 pts
- 4 pts for implementing each method

**Note**: Do  NOT use list comprehensions or techniques that are not included in your readings.  

### Incremental development, 20 pts
- 1 initial commit: to document all files with the developer and collaborator(s) names, 2 pts
- 3 commits for the development of the constructor: additional testing, design, and implementation, 2 points each, 6 pts total
- 3 commits for the development of each method for a total of 6 commits, 2 points each, 12 pts total

### Code analysis and styling, 8 pts

## Submission
### GitHub
- Local commit history and and all committed changes are pushed to the remote repository

### Canvas
- Convert `DESIGN.md` to PDF using Microsoft extension available in VS Code, Markdown PDF
- Upload the PDf to the submission link in Canvas.

## Guidelines
1. **Document** ALL files with the names of the developer and collaborator(s)
  - Version control this step
2. **Understand** what each method is supposed to do, based on the docstring 
   description, BEFORE writing the test cases.
3. Write **testing funcionts** to demonstrate your understanding of each method.
  - Version control this step.
4. **Design** each method before coding, including the constructor.
  - Version control this setp
5. **Write code** incrementally, one method at a time
  - Version control this step
6. Run the tests, debug and fix errors as you go.
  - Version control this step, if needed.
7. Repeat steps 2 tp 6.
8. **Code analysis and style**: fix all problems.

## Collaboration
Collaboration is allowed.

- Ask questions of your collaborator, CAs, and instructor; 
- Answer questions and give advice to your peers via the Discussion posts, during study group, or one-on-one collaborations;  
  - Discuss and clarify concepts; 
  - Show or practice concepts on simple examples. 

You are NOT allowed to give your work on this assignment to somebody else,
  or to do it for someone else. Collaboration is sharing ideas as they are 
  developed; it is not sharing code.
